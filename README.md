## What I Learned From These Technologies

Learning a lot of Javascript and CSS concepts are quite complex for someone who is starting to study CSS for classes, animations and divs.
in javascript it was quite challenging because learning ForEach,addEventListener.


The most difficult course was javascript where to learn the scroll, to make a carousel with images, paragraphs, how to put a class in javascript, how to put an id in javascript, and how to use the addEventListener on the click button. but surely it was organized all this information and not miss any vingula!

As for css, not much, just the basics of a beginner front end programmer and making animations with keyframes.
